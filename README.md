## Regression

Regression analysis is a set of statistical methods used for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the outcome or target variable) and one or more independent variables (often called predictors or features). The goal of regression is to model the relationship between these variables so that we can make predictions or understand the underlying patterns.

### Linear Regression

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used regression techniques. It assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The equation of a simple linear regression model (with one predictor) can be expressed as:

\[ y = wx + b \]

- \( y \) is the dependent variable (target variable).
- \( b \) is the intercept (the value of \( y \) when \( x \) is zero).
- \( w \) is the slope (the change in \( y \) for a one-unit change in \( x \).

### Multivariable Regression

Multivariable (or multiple) regression extends linear regression to include multiple independent variables. The model aims to predict the dependent variable based on several predictors. The equation of a multivariable regression model can be expressed as:

\[ y = W0X0 + W1X1 + ... + WnXn \]

Multivariable regression helps us understand the relationship between the target variable and multiple predictors simultaneously, allowing for more accurate predictions and insights.

## Classification

Classification is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict the categorical label of an instance based on its features. It involves assigning inputs to one of several predefined categories or classes.

### Logistic Regression

Despite its name, logistic regression is used for classification problems rather than regression problems. It is used to predict the probability of a binary outcome (1/0, Yes/No, True/False) based on one or more independent variables.

The logistic regression model uses the logistic function (also called the sigmoid function) to model the probability of the default class (usually 1).

Logistic regression can be extended to handle multiclass classification problems using techniques like one-vs-rest (OvR) or softmax regression.

### Example Projects Using These Techniques

#### Regression Projects

1. **House Price Prediction**: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms using linear and multivariable regression.
2. **Salary Prediction**: Predicting salaries based on years of experience and other factors using linear and multivariable regression.

#### Classification Projects

1. **Iris Classification**: Classifying iris species based on sepal and petal dimensions using logistic regression and other classification algorithms.
2. **Salary Classification**: Predicting whether a salary is above or below a certain threshold using logistic regression.
3. **Handwritten Digit Classification**: Classifying handwritten digits (0-9) using logistic regression (and potentially more advanced techniques like neural networks).

These projects demonstrate the application of regression and classification techniques to real-world problems, providing a foundation for understanding and implementing machine learning models.
