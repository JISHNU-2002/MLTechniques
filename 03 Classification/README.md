## Classification

Classification is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict the categorical label of an instance based on its features. It involves assigning inputs to one of several predefined categories or classes.

### Logistic Regression

Despite its name, logistic regression is used for classification problems rather than regression problems. It is used to predict the probability of a binary outcome (1/0, Yes/No, True/False) based on one or more independent variables.

The logistic regression model uses the logistic function (also called the sigmoid function) to model the probability of the default class (usually 1).

Logistic regression can be extended to handle multiclass classification problems using techniques like one-vs-rest (OvR) or softmax regression.


#### Classification Projects

1. **Iris Classification**: Classifying iris species based on sepal and petal dimensions using logistic regression and other classification algorithms.
2. **Salary Classification**: Predicting whether a salary is above or below a certain threshold using logistic regression.
3. **Handwritten Digit Classification**: Classifying handwritten digits (0-9) using logistic regression (and potentially more advanced techniques like neural networks).

These projects demonstrate the application of regression and classification techniques to real-world problems, providing a foundation for understanding and implementing machine learning models.
