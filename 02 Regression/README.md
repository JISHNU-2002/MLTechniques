## Regression

Regression analysis is a set of statistical methods used for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the outcome or target variable) and one or more independent variables (often called predictors or features). The goal of regression is to model the relationship between these variables so that we can make predictions or understand the underlying patterns.

### Linear Regression

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used regression techniques. It assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The equation of a simple linear regression model (with one predictor) can be expressed as:

\[ y = wx + b \]

- \( y \) is the dependent variable (target variable).
- \( b \) is the intercept (the value of \( y \) when \( x \) is zero).
- \( w \) is the slope (the change in \( y \) for a one-unit change in \( x \).

### Multivariable Regression

Multivariable (or multiple) regression extends linear regression to include multiple independent variables. The model aims to predict the dependent variable based on several predictors. The equation of a multivariable regression model can be expressed as:

\[ y = W0X0 + W1X1 + ... + WnXn \]

Multivariable regression helps us understand the relationship between the target variable and multiple predictors simultaneously, allowing for more accurate predictions and insights.


### Example Projects Using These Techniques

#### Regression Projects

1. **House Price Prediction**: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms using linear and multivariable regression.
2. **Salary Prediction**: Predicting salaries based on years of experience and other factors using linear and multivariable regression.
